There are several parts to this project.

1. Make college football picks based on games in picks.txt which should be in format, 
  "team1 vs team2" on each line followed by a tie breaker game.
  
2. Read Google Sheet to get players and picks.

3. Update Sheet when games complete.

Method: Scrapes content for two different sites. One for the vegas lines to make picks. The other
  is cbs sports to get the scores and status of games.
